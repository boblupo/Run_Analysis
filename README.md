Run_Analysis
============

Programming Assignment 02 from Getting and Cleaning Data (Cousera MOOC)

  Creates one R script called run_analysis.R from the UCI HAR Dataset
  that does the following. 

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation 
  for each measurement. 

  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
     with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


     Saves the data set from step 5 to a text file called tidydataset.txt.
